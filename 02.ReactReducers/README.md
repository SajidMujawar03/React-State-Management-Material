# Counter App with React useReducer

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of the `useReducer` hook to manage state in a counter component.

## Concept of Reducers

In React, a reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. It is inspired by the Redux library but can be used directly in React functional components via the `useReducer` hook.

### How Reducers Work
- **State**: Represents the current data or condition of the application (e.g., `{ count: 0 }`).
- **Action**: An object that describes what change should occur (e.g., `{ type: "increment" }`). Actions typically include a `type` property to identify the operation.
- **Reducer Function**: Uses a `switch` statement (or similar logic) to handle different action types and compute the next state without mutating the original state.

In this app:
- The reducer handles two actions: "increment" (adds 1 to the count) and "decrement" (subtracts 1 from the count).
- If an unknown action is dispatched, the reducer returns the current state unchanged.

Example from the code:
```typescript
const reducer = (state: State, action: Action): State => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

The `useReducer` hook initializes the state and provides a `dispatch` function to send actions:
```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
```

### Importance of Reducers
Reducers are crucial for managing complex state logic in React applications because:
- **Predictability**: They enforce a unidirectional data flow, making state changes easier to trace and debug.
- **Separation of Concerns**: State logic is centralized in the reducer, keeping components focused on rendering UI.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for apps with shared or nested state, as reducers can handle intricate updates (e.g., combining multiple reducers or handling side effects with middleware in larger setups like Redux).
- **Immutability**: Encourages creating new state objects, which aligns with React's efficient re-rendering via shallow comparisons.
- **Testability**: Pure functions without side effects are straightforward to unit test.

In contrast to `useState`, `useReducer` shines when state transitions depend on previous state or involve multiple sub-values, reducing boilerplate and improving readability in growing applications.
